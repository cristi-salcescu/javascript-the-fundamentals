### JavaScript: The Fundamentals

JavaScript is the language of the web and one of the most used programming languages.

It puts together some powerful features like closures, functions as values, objects as dynamic collections of properties,experimental characteristics, the prototype system, and some dangerous features such as the type coercion system.

Here are some of the things you will learn:

* The core primitives: numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, null and undefined.
* How to reuse blocks of code with function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.
* All the basic data structures: objects, arrays, sets, and maps and the differences between them.
* All the possible scopes of a variable: global, module, function, block, and lexical scope.
* Insights in the asynchronous model
* Tips on how to avoid the automatic type conversion
* The core features of JavaScript that make it unique in a sense
